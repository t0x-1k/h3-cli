# Given a graphql query file and a search path (H3_CLI_GQL_PATH) containing *Fragment.graphql files, 
# resolve all unersolved Fragments in the graphql query by importing them from their respective 
# *Fragment.graphql file.
#
# Fragments can be defined in their own file, named {fragment-name}.graphql.
# Those Fragments can then be referenced from a graphql query file in the usual way
# using the spread operator, ie: "...{fragment-name}".
#
# Fragments can also be defined directly in the graphql query file. This effectively overrides
# the *Fragment.graphql file, if one is defined.  This script will only resolve Fragments that are 
# not already defined in the query file.

# subtract already-defined fragments 
# :returns: the remaining set of fragments.  These are the unresolved fragments that need to be imported.
